### To Build the Books

To build all of the books, open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this repository, and type the following command:

        $ scripts/buildGuides.sh

The script provides links to both AsciiDoctor and ccutil builds for each of the example books.

You can also build a single guide. Navigate to the folder of the book you want to build and type the following command:

        $ ./buildGuide.sh

### To modify the Example Book for Your Documentation

1. Add your Asciidoc `*.adoc` files to the `topics/` folder.
2. Replace the values in the `docs/topics/document-attributes.adoc` file for your documentation.
  * Replace the product names and releases.
  * Replace the book names.
3. Use 'git mv' to rename the book folder names.

        $ cd My_Title_A
        $ git mv My_Title_A Installation_Guide.

4. In a terminal, navigate to each book folder and add the symlink to the `topics/` using this command:

        $ ln -s ../topics topics
        
5. Within each book folder, modify the `master-docinfo.xml` file to set the appropriate title, product, release, and other values for the build of the book to the portal.
6. Within each book folder, modify the `master.adoc` file to set the appropriate title, document attributes, and include the appropriate `topics/` content.
7. When you are ready, run the scripts to build the guides and review the output to make sure it looks correct.
