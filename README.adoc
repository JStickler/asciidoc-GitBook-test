# Hawkular Documentation Repository

This repository contains the documentation for Red Hat middleware management (also known by the upstream project name http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular]).

NOTE: The default name used by the CCS tooling for the  main file that defines the structure of the document or contains all the AsciiDoc content for the document is `master.adoc`.  This repository uses that naming convention.

This repository is based on https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccs-tools-documentation/up-down-repo-template[this template] and uses the following directory structure:

....
├── README.md (This file)
├── docs (This folder contains all the asciidoc topics and top level content spec)
│   ├── Title_A
│   │   ├── master.adoc
│   │   ├── master-docinfo.xml
│   │   ├── buildGuide.sh (script to build this guide)
│   │   ├── topics -> ../topics/ (symlink to docs/topics/)
│   ├── Title_B
│   │   ├── master.adoc
│   │   ├── master-docinfo.xml
│   │   ├── buildGuide.sh (script to build this guide)

### To Build the Books

To build all of the books, open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this repository, and type the following command:

        $ scripts/buildGuides.sh

The script provides links to both AsciiDoctor and ccutil builds for each of the example books.

You can also build a single guide. Navigate to the folder of the book you want to build and type the following command:

        $ ./buildGuide.sh

### To modify the Example Book for Your Documentation

1. Add your Asciidoc `*.adoc` files to the `topics/` folder.
2. Replace the values in the `docs/topics/document-attributes.adoc` file for your documentation.
  * Replace the product names and releases.
  * Replace the book names.
3. Use 'git mv' to rename the book folder names.

        $ cd My_Title_A
        $ git mv My_Title_A Installation_Guide.

4. In a terminal, navigate to each book folder and add the symlink to the `topics/` using this command:

        $ ln -s ../topics topics

5. Within each book folder, modify the `master-docinfo.xml` file to set the appropriate title, product, release, and other values for the build of the book to the portal.
6. Within each book folder, modify the `master.adoc` file to set the appropriate title, document attributes, and include the appropriate `topics/` content.
7. When you are ready, run the scripts to build the guides and review the output to make sure it looks correct.
