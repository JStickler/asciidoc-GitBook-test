= Middleware Management Overview


Middleware management in CloudForms is a provider based on the Hawkular open source project
The middleware provider extends CloudForms management capabilities to JBoss Middleware application containers running in managed virtual machines, hosts, and Linux containers. The provider will deliver inventory, events, metrics, and power operations.
When feature complete, the middleware provider will replace the current Red Hat middleware management offering, JBoss Operations Network.
