Adding a New Middleware Provider

. Log in to the CloudForms Management Engine as a user who has permissions to add providers. The default user is `admin`, password `smartvm`.
. Select menu:Middleware[Providers].
. Click the *Configuration* button and select *Add a New Middleware Provider* from the menu.
. In the Add a New Middleware Provider screen, enter the following:

* *Name* - Enter a name for the provider, for example, Middleware Manager.
* *Type* = Hawkular
* *Zone*
+
Endpoints

* *Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)* Hostname of the machine where you installed the middleware manager.
+
////
The Hostname must use a unique fully qualified domain name?
////
* *API Port* = Port of the middleware manager. The default is 8080.
* *User Name* - The user name used to start the middleware manager.  
* *Password*
* *Confirm Password*
+
. Before you add the provider, click the *Validate* button to confirm that the user has the proper credentials.
+
====
IMPORTANT: Click the Validate button.

There is an internal flag that indicates if the provider is validated or not. If you do not validate the provider, the Middleware Provider does not start all of the worker threads. Then, if the provider goes down, CloudForms may flag it as disabled in the database and you will be unable to restart it.

. Click *Add*.
