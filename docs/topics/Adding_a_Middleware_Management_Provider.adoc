. In the Add a New Middleware Provider screen, enter the following:

* *Name* - Enter a name for the provider, for example, Middleware Manager.
* *Type* = Hawkular
* *Zone*

Endpoints

* *Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)* Hostname of the machine where you installed the middleware manager.

IMPORTANT: Click the Validate button.

There is an internal flag that indicates if the provider is validated or not. If you do not validate the provider, the Middleware Provider does not start all of the worker threads. Then, if the provider goes down, CloudForms may flag it as disabled in the database and you will be unable to restart it.
