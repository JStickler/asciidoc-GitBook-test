Before you install :ProductName: you should have the following items:

////
QUESTION - What specific permissions does this user need?
////
* A non-root user to perform the installation
* The IP/Hostname and port of your Cassandra server
* Entitlement?  (once we figure out how thatâ€™s going to work)
* A user with permission to write to the Cassandra data store
(used for ongoing operations)
